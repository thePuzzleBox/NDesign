After graduating from community college, he was able to transfer as one of the 1% accepted, and is working toward receiving his Bachelor's. With experience working with city government and as a Youth Ambassador for the Human Rights Campaign, Jalen has an extensive background in serving underrepresented communities.\n\n
And in his free time, he is an avid gamer, moviegoer, walking Marvel encyclopedia, and amateur skateboarder who loves meeting new people and bonding over just about anything... preferably video games! As a gamer and a writer, he's found great appreciation for emotionally-driven storytelling. And because of this, he aspires to do work in narrative design one day, as one of his dreams he has yet to accomplish.
