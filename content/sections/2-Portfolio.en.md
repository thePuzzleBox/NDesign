    content: "And though character actions are a direct reflection of player choices, I wanted to explore what characters are and how they are beings of their own without the player. So the first question I asked was: “In what ways does the writer add depth to create real, three-dimensional characters?” I thought it would be better if I first addressed what a character is before I build on the idea further. So I found a great guide on video game design. I read player characters (PCs) are the individuals controlled as the game is played. How they live, behave, rebel, change, grow, and even die within the worlds we create have the greatest influence on a single playthrough (Dille). With that in mind, I return to my question. I went to a website with various video game discussions in search of an answer, and learned that a three-dimensional character needs flaws and complex motives. They must react to new dilemmas logically based on past experiences (“Difference”). I completely agree with this because a character is great not because of their perfection, but their imperfection. They prove not to be static or a cliché. I can understand, now, how their complicity gives them their value. My next question is: “What forms the sentimental bond between character and player in a video game?” Luckily for me, Mr. Garriss was able to answer this exact question in his own words. He said that vulnerability is key; it’s about building empathy, that’s how the player is made to feel in their marrow that their choices have impacts in human ways on human lives (Garriss). Reading this for the first time, it was completely new to my perception. But because I already established that flaws are essential to character development, it’s no surprise. In addition, with the help of a book, I was able to learn that the powerful connection developed between the character and player is known as parasocial interaction (Isbister). This came to me as a relief, as I can finally put a name to this unexplainable relationship. And to conclude what binds this interaction with games, I resorted to another book. There, the author’s answer was a technique he coined, “emotioneering,” creating a depth of emotions in effort to immerse a player in a game (Freeman). And again, I am graciously gifted another vocabulary word to help me explain to others what I’m still trying to understand myself. Now, I finally asked, “In what ways are characters the driving force behind a compelling narrative game?” To answer this, I found an article. It explained that players want to understand the characters’ challenges, sympathise with their sufferings, and experience their journey with them (Sakey). That is the drive behind game narrative. I believe it is our instinct to wonder and see what happens next to a someone we’ve grown fond of, concluding that video game characters are more than just mediums by which players enter a virtual world. But, they are our sole investment when playing a video game, which keeps us captivated every step of the way",

    content: "After years of speculation regarding the future of the DC Entertainment Universe, last Thursday, Marvel Studios executives discreetly confirmed through Twitter the other day that they had finally acquired the rights to the caped crusader. This comes as no surprise to fans as WarnerBros. Entertainment has had a hard and long, documented history of putting millions into meaningless reboots rather than a better writers’ room. This would mean a record-breaking fifth reboot to the Batman series coming not long after the newest iteration starring actor Robert Pattinson.\n\n
    
    	After the success of Matt Reeves’s The Batman’s release in 2022, DC execs reportedly saw an opportunity for a quick cash grab and finally withdrew their rights to the character to its contender just as the company was gaining its first glimpse of good publicity and high acclaim in a long time. A representative of the company released a statement early Friday morning reading, “In light of yesterday’s major decision, we and all of Warner Brothers, are extremely grateful to have been given the privilege of bringing the character Batman to life and for the immense support he’s received over the years. However, we sought it best for a truly remarkable (and consistent) comic book studio to continue the legacy of The Dark Knight. With that, we came to the unanimous conclusion that this would be the best move financially for our company. Rather than investing the time and resources in developing the already-existing universe, we thought it better to start anew one last time. By passing the mantle to a talented group of individuals who are better equipped to craft years worth of continuity, we have no doubt they will exceed our expectations with this one. Though this marks an end of an era, we hope fans will enjoy what Marvel has in store and that you join us for this new chapter in cinematic history \n\n
     As the film’s slated to begin production ealy 2027, we spoke with some important figures involved in this multi-billion-dollar deal. One of which is Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, who commented, “We’re really excited to bring Bruce Wayne into the Marvel family and what this means for the future of the Marvel Universe.” Feige is the enterprise’s Chief Creative Officer and is often credited with the success of the world’s  highest-grossing film franchise, spanning over a decade with continuous plans for the future. “We are really looking forward to bringing the dark themes and grittiness of Batman into the MCU as it’s something we’ve yet to explore and show at Marvel. Similar to the huge excitement behind movies like Endgame, we’re so ready to have that moment where the audience will go wild seeing Thomas and Martha Wayne getting shot in front of a young Bruce. Fans will go crazy. They’ll love it.”...",

    content: "In the episode titled “Pickle Rick” of the animated adult show Rick and Morty on Adult Swim, creators Justin Roiland and Dan Haromon utilize an array of humorous elements within the segment and clearly demonstrate traces of the incongruity theory of humor. The episode as usual starts with the family’s drunk and unhinged patriarch, Rick Sanchez doing something crazy which is turning himself into a pickle. He explains to Morty the fascination and immense accomplishment of him assuming the form of this edible, everyday, inanimate object. The audience would find this particularly amusing since it is simply bizarre and ridiculous and Rick very much prizes his “new look” because of how unthought-of and “ingenious” it almost is. Come to find out, through the reveal of an elaborate and thoroughly thought-out contraption to revert him back to his normal self, it was all in order to avoid their family counseling session they have in ten minutes. Furthermore, this simply illustrated the inability to solve familial problems with crazed scientist Rick Sanchez, who’d much rather deal with the problems of being a pickle rather than face the ones he currently has caused as a grandfather...",
