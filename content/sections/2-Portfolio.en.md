    About the Game:\n\n
    Explore across the golden front of Crow's Canyon and play as broken sheriff Judd Henrie. Having lost his rookie and partner in-training Bailey Finkle, Henrie is on an unhinged path to redemption for the outlaw and mercenary Jebediah Vandisch. Along the way, the sheriff will encounter some untimely folk (and foes) as he finds himself in many bar fights on the journey. One of which is a mysterious young woman (and troublemaker) named Fiona who has information he needs but isn't the nicest to authority.\n\n
    As the two stop bank heists and runaway-trains, they make the unlikely duo that the town never knew they needed.\n\n\n",

    And though character actions are a direct reflection of player choices, I wanted to explore what characters are and how they are beings of their own without the player. So the first question I asked was: “In what ways does the writer add depth to create real, three-dimensional characters?” I thought it would be better if I first addressed what a character is before I build on the idea further. So I found a great guide on game design. I read player characters (PCs) are the individuals controlled as the game is played. How they live, behave, rebel, change, grow, and even die within the worlds we create have the greatest influence on a single playthrough (Dille). With that in mind, I learned that a three-dimensional character needs flaws and complex motives. They must react to new dilemmas logically based on past experiences (“Difference”). So a character is great not because of their perfection, but their imperfection. They prove not to be static or a cliché because their complicity gives them value.\n\n
    My next question is: “What forms the sentimental bond between character and player in a video game?” Luckily for me, Mr. Garriss was able to answer this exact question in his own words. He said that vulnerability is key; it’s about building empathy, that’s how the player is made to feel in their marrow that their choices have impacts in human ways on human lives (Garriss). Hearing his response was eye-opening but because I already established that flaws are essential to character development, it was to no surprise. I was able to learn that the powerful connection developed between the character and player is known as parasocial interaction (Isbister). And again, I am graciously gifted another vocabulary word to help me explain to others what I have tried to explain for so long.\n\n
    Now, I finally asked, “In what ways are characters the driving force behind a compelling narrative game?” To answer this, I found an article. It explained that players want to understand the characters’ challenges, sympathise with their sufferings, and experience their journey with them (Sakey). That is the drive behind game narrative. I believe it is our instinct to wonder and see what happens next to a someone we’ve grown fond of, concluding that video game characters are more than just mediums by which players enter a virtual world. But, they are our sole investment when playing a video game, which keeps us captivated every step of the way.\n\n

He was a stranger in this strange land.\n\n
With his red serape moving with the sea’s breeze, his smoking cigar, with every puff, burned against the cold night. Like a leper, he mysteriously kept his left arm covered from onlookers with his shawl. And as he slowly walked the streets of this crime-filled, harbor city, the gold letters embellished on his belt relayed the message that he was, in fact, an outsider.\n\n
“BAMF,” it weirdly read under the moonlit sky.\n\n
After passing three others, he stopped in front of the entrance of yet another bar. He looked at the sign overhead but upon hearing the muffled sound of drunken laughter, he knew he reached the right place.\n\n

    content: "After years of speculation regarding the future of the DC Entertainment Universe, last Thursday, Marvel Studios executives discreetly confirmed through Twitter the other day that they had finally acquired the rights to the caped crusader. This comes as no surprise to fans as WarnerBros. Entertainment has had a hard and long, documented history of putting millions into meaningless reboots rather than a better writers’ room. This would mean a record-breaking fifth reboot to the Batman series coming not long after the newest iteration starring actor Robert Pattinson.\n\n
     As the film’s slated to begin production ealy 2027, we spoke with some important figures involved in this multi-billion-dollar deal. One of which is Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, who commented, “We’re really excited to bring Bruce Wayne into the Marvel family and what this means for the future of the Marvel Universe.” Feige is the enterprise’s Chief Creative Officer and is often credited with the success of the world’s  highest-grossing film franchise, spanning over a decade with continuous plans for the future. “We are really looking forward to bringing the dark themes and grittiness of Batman into the MCU as it’s something we’ve yet to explore and show at Marvel. Similar to the huge excitement behind movies like Endgame, we’re so ready to have that moment where the audience will go wild seeing Thomas and Martha Wayne getting shot in front of a young Bruce. Fans will go crazy. They’ll love it.”\n\n

    content: "In the episode titled “Pickle Rick” of the animated adult show Rick and Morty on Adult Swim, creators Justin Roiland and Dan Haromon utilize an array of humorous elements within the segment and clearly demonstrate traces of the incongruity theory of humor.\n\n
    The episode as usual starts with the family’s drunk and unhinged patriarch, Rick Sanchez doing something crazy which is turning himself into a pickle. He explains to Morty the fascination and immense accomplishment of him assuming the form of this edible, everyday, inanimate object. The audience would find this particularly amusing since it is simply bizarre and ridiculous and Rick very much prizes his “new look” because of how unthought-of and “ingenious” it almost is.\n\n
    Come to find out, through the reveal of an elaborate and thoroughly thought-out contraption to revert him back to his normal self, it was all in order to avoid their family counseling session they have in ten minutes.\n\n
    Furthermore, this simply illustrated the inability to solve familial problems with crazed scientist Rick Sanchez, who’d much rather deal with the problems of being a pickle rather than face the ones he currently has caused as a grandfather.\n\n
